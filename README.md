## What is React?
- React is a javascript based frontend framework.
- The idea of React is to break up your code into different components that you combine together to make your application.
- React uses a markup syntax called JSX.
  - React components are javascript functions.
- React components recieve data and return what should appear on screen.
  - You can pass them new data in response to an interaction, like when a user types into an input.
  - React will then update the screen to match the new data.
- You don't have to build your whole page/application in react. You can add React to an existing html project.
- React is a library that lets you put components together.
  - It doesnâ€™t prescribe how to do routing and data fetching.
  - To build an entire app with Reactyou'll need a full-stack React framework
    -  Next.js or Remix for example
- React can be used to build web or native apps.

## Creating a React App
- In the terminal run `npm install vite@latest`
- You'll need to install create-vite if you don't already have it.
- For project name use `.` to use your current directory/repo
- Choose the React framework and Javascript + SWC
- Run `npm i` to get your dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to run your newly created App.

## Understanding Our React App
- The index.html and src/main.jsx are hooking up to one another
- Our src/App.jsx has a function that is being exported as our React App
  - A function inside React that starts with a capital letter is essentially a component.
     - A component is a function that returns jsx code.

### React + Vite
- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
- Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
